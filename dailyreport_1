**Project:** Pizza Price Prediction

**Tasks Accomplished Today:**

1.  **Project Initiation and Setup:**
    * Confirmed the "Pizza Price Prediction" project as the chosen topic.
    * Identified the "Pizza-Price.csv" dataset from Kaggle (specifically the one located at the user's provided path: `C:\Users\caner\OneDrive\Desktop\ML_Project\Pizza-Price.csv`) as the data source.
    * Developed and refined the initial Python script structure for the complete machine learning workflow.

2.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**
    * Implemented robust code to load the `Pizza-Price.csv` dataset using pandas, including error handling for file not found.
    * Integrated a crucial step to print the actual column names from the user's CSV (`pizza_df.columns`) to help resolve `KeyError` issues.
    * Performed basic data exploration: displaying `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`, and `isnull().sum()`.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Generated various visualizations to understand data characteristics and relationships:
        * Histograms for numerical features (pizza size, price).
        * Count plots for categorical features (restaurant, extra toppings).
        * Scatter plot for visualizing the relationship between pizza size and price.
        * Box plots for comparing price distributions across different categories.
    * Successfully viewed these initial EDA graphics, confirming the data loading and basic plotting functionalities.

4.  **Code Refinement and Language Standardization:**
    * Addressed user feedback to translate Python code identifiers (variable names, etc.) to English for better readability and standard practice.
    * Maintained comments in Turkish as per user request to ensure their understanding of the code logic.
    * Focused on making the code cleaner and more organized.

5.  **Clarification of Project Steps:**
    * Discussed and explained the purpose and necessity of the completed EDA steps.
    * Outlined the upcoming stages of the project: data preprocessing, model training/optimization, evaluation, and visualization, confirming their importance for the project.

**Challenges/Issues:**

* The primary challenge encountered earlier was `KeyError` due to discrepancies between assumed column names in the code and actual column names in the user's CSV file. This was addressed by adding dynamic column name checking and clear instructions for the user to update relevant variables. The user's confirmation of seeing EDA graphics suggests this issue is now largely resolved.

**Plan for Next Steps (Implicit in the provided complete script):**

1.  **Execute Full Script:** Run the complete Python script which includes:
    * **Data Preprocessing:** Applying `ColumnTransformer` with `StandardScaler` and `OneHotEncoder`.
    * **Train/Test Split:** Dividing data for model training and evaluation.
    * **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:** Training Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVR models using `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV`.
    * **Model Evaluation:** Calculating and comparing performance metrics (R-squared, MSE, RMSE, MAE).
    * **Results Visualization:** Plotting predictions vs. actuals and residuals for the best model.
2.  **Review Model Outputs:** Analyze the performance metrics and visualizations generated by the script.
3.  **Prepare Final Project Report:** Structure and write the final project report based on the requirements and the findings from the script.
